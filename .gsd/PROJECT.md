# DeepC

## What This Is

DeepC is an open-source suite of deep-compositing Nuke NDK plugins targeting Foundry Nuke 16+. Ships 24 plugins covering color, matte, noise, shuffle, utility, blur, and deep-sample optimisation operations on deep images. Core plugins are built on two shared C++ base classes (`DeepCWrapper`, `DeepCMWrapper`); DeepThinner and DeepCBlur use `DeepFilterOp` directly. Highlights: DeepCShuffle2 features a full Qt6 custom knob UI with colored channel routing, DeepCPMatte provides an interactive 3D wireframe GL handle, DeepCPNoise supports true 4D noise evolution across all 9 noise types, DeepThinner reduces deep sample counts via seven independent artist-controllable passes, DeepCBlur provides Gaussian blur for deep images with sample propagation and per-pixel optimization, DeepCDepthBlur spreads each deep sample across sub-samples in Z with physically correct alpha decomposition, and developers can build for all target Nuke versions on Linux and Windows via a single Docker-based script.

## Core Value

Artists can use deep-compositing operations in Nuke that don't exist in the built-in toolset, with professional-quality UIs and reliable deep-pixel math.

## Current State

**M007-gvtoom S03 complete (all slices done).** 24 plugins (old DeepCDefocusPO removed, replaced by DeepCDefocusPOThin + DeepCDefocusPORay). DeepCDefocusPOThin: full thin-lens CoC scatter engine (S02). DeepCDefocusPORay: full raytraced gather engine (S03) — CoC-bounded neighbourhood search, aperture vignetting via aperture.fit, sphereToCs for physical ray direction, gather selectivity guard, holdout transmittance, CA at 0.45/0.55/0.65μm, Halton+Shirley sampling, _max_degree truncation. Both `test/test_thin.nk` and `test/test_ray.nk` at 128×72 with Angenieux 55mm ready for docker build + runtime UAT. All structural verification contracts pass. Remaining gate: docker build + `nuke -x` runtime proof (CI/assembly).

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- **Three plugin tiers**: `PLUGINS` (direct `DeepFilterOp`), `PLUGINS_WRAPPED` (`DeepCWrapper` base), `PLUGINS_MWRAPPED` (`DeepCMWrapper` base)
- **Build**: CMake 3.15+, C++17, Qt 6.5.3 for DeepCShuffle2 custom knob, NukeDockerBuild Docker images for Linux + Windows. Local dev: run the project build script — a symlink from the build output directory into Nuke's plugin path means no separate install step is needed; rebuilding in-place is sufficient.
- **Menu**: `python/menu.py.in` CMake template with category variables (`DRAW_NODES`, `FILTER_NODES`, etc.)
- **Shared headers**: `DeepSampleOptimizer.h` — header-only sample merge/cap utility in `deepc` namespace, zero DDImage deps
- **PO shared infrastructure**: `poly.h` (MIT, vendored from lentil) — polynomial lens reader/evaluator; `deepc_po_math.h` — Halton, Shirley disk, CoC, Newton trace helpers
- **Platform**: Linux primary, Windows supported, macOS not maintained
- **Constraints**: Nuke 16+ only, `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1`, GCC 11.2.1, GPL-3.0
